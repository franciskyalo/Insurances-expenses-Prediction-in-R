## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

# INSURANCE PREMIUMS PREDICTIONS USING LINEAR REGRESSION

The aim of this project is use the insurance dataset to come up with a model that can predict the amount an individual is supposed to pay as insurance expenses considering a number of factors such as age, BMI, sex, number of children, smoker status, and region.

```{r}
# importing important libraries

library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(dlookr)
library(performance)
```

```{r}
# reading in  the dataset 

df <- read_csv("~/R projects/insurance expenses ML/Insurances-expenses-Prediction-in-R/Insurancedata.csv")
```

```{r}
df %>% head()
```

```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(age))+
  geom_histogram(fill='blue', bins = 10)
```

```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(bmi))+
  geom_histogram(fill='yellow',bins = 10)
```

```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(expenses))+
  geom_histogram(fill='lightgreen', bins = 10)
```

```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(region, fill=region))+
  geom_bar()
```

```{r}
ggplot(df,aes(sex, fill=sex))+
  geom_bar()
```

```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(age, expenses, fill=smoker))+
  geom_point(color='grey')+
  geom_smooth()
```

```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(bmi, expenses, fill=smoker))+
  geom_point(color='grey')+
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm')
```

```{r}
df %>% group_by(smoker) %>% summarise(average_expenses = mean(expenses)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(smoker, average_expenses, fill=smoker))+
    geom_bar(stat = 'identity')
```

```{r}
df %>% group_by(sex) %>% summarise(average_expenses = mean(expenses)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(sex, average_expenses, fill=sex))+
    geom_bar(stat = 'identity')
```

```{r}
df %>% group_by(region) %>% summarise(average_expenses = mean(expenses)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(region, average_expenses, fill=region))+
    geom_bar(stat = 'identity')
```

```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(children, expenses))+
  geom_point(color='red', alpha=0.7)
```
